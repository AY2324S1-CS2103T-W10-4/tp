# 1. Introduction <a id="1-introduction"></a>
Welcome to the User Guide of **FoodNotes**!

Ever find yourself forgetting the delightful dishes you savored? Hungry for a way to recall your favorite food experiences? FoodNotes has the solution.

FoodNotes is a quick, simple and beautiful food diary made specifically for you, NUS student foodies. With FoodNotes, you can add stalls that you want to keep track of and manage your reviews for them.

This application is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a Command Box. If you are fast at typing, you can manage your food reviews faster than other Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.
FoodNotes is available for the Linux, Unix, Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
