### Project: FoodNotes

FoodNotes is a desktop address book application used to record reviews on food stalls and menus. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the functionality to view a stall details.
  * **PR(s):** [#60](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/60)
  * **What it does:** Allows the user to view stall details which include stall reviews and menu items in the stall.
  * **Justification:** This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to
  * **Highlights:** This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future as any change to the fields of a stall or item will change how it is added. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, for example how to handle adding reviews if they don't already exist, as it is not compulsory for stalls or items to have reviews in FoodNotes.
  * **Credits:** The ability to have optional parameters while adding was adapted from the `AddCommand` class in the original AB3.
